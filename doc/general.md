# General functioning

"easyRLS" is intended to provide a stable and efficient code base for computations on calcium imaging data. It can be run both as a step by step script and a workflow.

## Main processing steps
- drift correction
- mapping to reference brain
- neuron segmentation
- baseline computation
- DFF computation
