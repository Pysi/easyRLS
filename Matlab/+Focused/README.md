The 'Focused' function group is a wrapper for all "focusless" functions designed to be usable in whatever environment.

For instance, you can call `Mmap` constructor everywhere with a binary file path and an info file path, or call it with a 'Focus' and a 'tag' via `Focused.Mmap`.

For instance, you can call the focused `dcimgToMmap` with `Focused.dcimgToMmap`.
